# My FSJS Techdegree Project Warm Ups


## Description:
A collection of some completed examples of the fun educational coding exercises I've created.  I built these for the TD Project Warm Up feature that I invented to better support our students who were feeling unprepared for the early TD projects.

Each warm up is like a mini project and comes with a simple front end that includes basic markup, custom CSS, a JS starter file including helpful code comments and a README file with some basic instructions for getting started.  


## Explore:

To see the LIVE version, [visit: https://gitrobertpm.github.io/td-warm-ups/](https://gitrobertpm.github.io/td-warm-ups/)

Below a brief description are an inline list of custom drop down menus containing your options.  Selected Warm Ups are displayed in an iframe, where you can even click around and test the completed versions of the warm ups directly in the iframe without ever leaving the page.


## Dev Thoughts:
This unusual, or at least new, to me, technique seemed like a lightweight solution for easily and programmatically switching between different projects locally all in the same repo.  I avoided manually or even programmatically adding individual links to the different exercise.  So the URL in address bar never changes, since you never actually leave the page.  But the browser's forward and back buttons work well for moving between the individual exercises displayed directly in the iframe element.  So technically, what you seem to have here is a super simple version of an SPA.  If you could set up some basic routing, this might be a neat little technique.  Who knows, maybe more. :)
