          <p>In the custom dropdown menus below, you'll find buttons to change the display.</p>
          <p>Each one represents a coding exercise I put together while overseeing an online web development bootcamp.</p>
          <p>Each exercise contains a basic front end: a bit of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, a friendly user interface, maybe some images, and a helpful set of instructions that describe how to complete the exercise.</p>
          <p>And each was designed to provide students with an opportunity to practice some recently taught web development concept or technique.</p>
          <p>The point of these mini-app exercises was to provide a very approachable way to reinforce what the students were learning, while helping them prepare for the upcoming end-of-unit projects they would build.</p>
