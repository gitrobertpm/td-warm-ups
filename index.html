      <h1>FSJS Techdegree Project Warm Ups</h1>

      <p>Check out the custom drop down menus below to see some completed examples of the fun educational coding exercises I've created.  I built these for the TD Project Warm Up feature that I invented to better support our students who were feeling unprepared for the early TD projects.</p>

      <p>Each mini project comes with a simple front end that includes basic markup, custom CSS, a JS starter file including helpful code comments and a README file with some basic instructions for getting started.  Visit <a href="https://github.com/gitrobertpm/td-warm-ups" target="_blank">this GitHub repo</a> to check out the code.  And <b>CLICK</b> around in the iframe below to test them out.</p>
