### Intro

Creating functions is one of my favorite parts of writing code.  You've got some task you need to repeat over and over again, like say create a DOM element and give it some attributes and text.  But you want your code to be DRY.  So what do you do?  You create your very own custom helper function.  One way to approach this might go like this - the function takes in parameters for the type of element that's being created, an object with key/value pairs for the attributes and their values that need to be added to the element, and a string for the element's text, if it needs it.  Then in the body of the function, you create the element, loop over the object to add the attributes, add the text, and finally return the element.  Now your super cool and handy helper function can be called over and over to create as many DOM elements as you like.  And all that would need to be done then is append them to the DOM.  Which technically could be done in the same helper function.  Or perhaps multiple helper functions could be created, and called inside of each other to accomplish this.

In this exercise, you'll have the chance to do all these things. :)

And feel free to get some extgra practice and play around with this one.  Some images have been included that can be substituted for the boilerplate images.  You can make the text your own, if you like.  You can even add as many more elements as you like.  If you really want to push it, you could call your helper function in a loop with say 100 iterations, and really create something huge.  :wow:  

### Instructions

 Load the `index.html` file in Chrome and open the Chrome DevTools console.  If you don't know how to do that, please reach out in Slack.  Next, follow along with the comments in the `js/script.js` file to complete this challenge.  When you are done, clicking the test button should create and append DOM elements matching what has been commented out in the index.html file.

If you get stuck or have questions, reach out in the `#code-adventures` channel in your Slack team.

Best of luck and happy coding! :)
