// OBJECTIVES:

// In the index.html file, you'll find some commented out markup. 
// Your job is to programmatically recreate those elements and append them to the DOM.
// But instead of a purely procedural approach, try to employ reusable helper function(s) to accomplish your objectives.

// YOUR CODE GOES HERE!!! Do the steps below to complete this challenge

// Create one or more helper functions that will accomplish the following tasks:
// 1. Create a DOM element
// 2. Add any necessary attributes and attribute values to the created element
// 3. Add any necessary text to the created element
// 4. Append the element to the DOM

// NOTE: It will be helpful to log the element to the console along the way to easily inspect its values.
// NOTE: Helper functions that create or modify a DOM element should return that element.

// Once you have your helper functions, you can call them in the event listener below to see them in action when the button is clicked.
// You can refresh the page in the browser to clear the page and try again.
// NOTE: To see the what the page will look like when you are done, you can uncomment out the markup in index.html.

/* Click listener for test button */
document.querySelector('#btn').addEventListener('click', e => {

  // CALL YOUR HELPER FUNCTIONS HERE!!!


  // Helpful log statement to test function - You can comment out this if you like
  console.log('Test button is functional!');
});
