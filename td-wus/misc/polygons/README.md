# Treehouse FSJS Techdegree - Code Adventure

## Polygons

### Intro

Developers often have to come up with clever solutions to solve tricky situations.  This exercise is a chance to practice doing just that.  Youâ€™ll use JavaScript to write the logic for a provided function.  When complete, the function must determine and return the total number of squares in a polygon based on how many squares make up the length of one side.  Examples of some polygons, their side lengths and total squares have been provided for you.  Tests have been provided for you that will print your results to the page.  When you're done, your results will print green if they pass the tests, and red if they fail.

### Instructions

 Load the `index.html` file in Chrome and open the Chrome DevTools console.  If you don't know how to do that, please reach out in Slack.  Next, follow along with the comments in the `js/script.js` file to complete this challenge.  When you are done ---.

If you get stuck or have questions, reach out in the `#code-adventures` channel in your Slack team.

Best of luck and happy coding! :)
