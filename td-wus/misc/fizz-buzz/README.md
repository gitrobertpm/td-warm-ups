## The Classic Fizz Buzz Challenge

### Intro

The classic Fizz Buzz challenge is a common interview code exercise.  And it's a great way to get some extra coding practice.  It's one of those things that every coder should do at some point, and every job ready coder should be able to accomplish.  The goal is to print all the numbers from 1 - 100.  But if the number is a multiple of three, print 'Fizz' instead.  If the number is a multiple of five, print 'Buzz' instead.  And if the number is a multiple of three and five, print 'Fizz-Buzz' instead.  You can print these values to the console, but in this exercise, you've been given a front end project where you can also print those values to the page.  The button on the page is hooked up to an event listener that will run the function where you'll be writing your code.

### Instructions

 Load the `index.html` file in Chrome and open the Chrome DevTools console.  If you don't know how to do that, please reach out in Slack.  Next, follow along with the comments in the `js/script.js` file to complete this challenge.  When you are done, you should be able to click button on the page and the numbers 1 - 100 should print to the console and/or the page, replacing multiples of three with 'Fizz', multiples of five with 'Buzz', and multiples of three and five with 'Fizz-Buzz'.

If you get stuck or have questions, reach out in the `#code-adventures` channel in your Slack team.

Best of luck and happy coding! :)
