# Treehouse FSJS Techdegree - Code Adventure

## What's on the other side

### Intro

Many developers enjoy getting some extra practice with JavaScript by completing small code challenges that test their problem solving and analytical thinking skills.  Here’s a lightweight example of one of those challenges.  You’ll use JavaScript to find and return a point on a circle that is directly opposite a given point.  Details are on the web page.  Then you'll click the "Run Test" button on the page to run your code and see the results.

### Instructions

 Load the `index.html` file in Chrome and open the Chrome DevTools console.  If you don't know how to do that, please reach out in Slack.  Next, follow along with the instructions on the web page you'll see in Chrome after loading the `index.html` file, and comments in the `js/script.js` file to complete this challenge.  When you are done, clicking the "Run Tests" button will print the correct answers to the page.  The answers will be green if they are correct.

If you get stuck or have questions, reach out in the `#code-adventures` channel in your Slack team.

Best of luck and happy coding! :)
