# Treehouse FSJS Techdegree - Code Adventure

## Random Radlibs

### Intro

Here's a fun twist on the old classic Mad-Libs.  If you don't know what a Mad-lib is, it's basically a sentence or paragraph where you fill in certain words, like verbs, nouns, or adjectives for usually amusing results. Here’s some lightweight practice working with Strings, Arrays, Loops, Conditionals, Functions and random values.  You’ll use JavaScript to fill in some arrays, grab random words from the arrays, and use them to replace words in a test sentence that will be printed to the screen.

This challenge comes with some helpful tests that will try to provide additional info to let you know where you might be off if the tests don't pass.  Click the Run Tests button to see the results.

  

### Instructions

Load the `index.html` file in Chrome and open the Chrome DevTools console.  If you don't know how to do that, please reach out in Slack, or try Googling it.  Next, follow along with the comments in the `js/script.js` file to complete this challenge.  When you are done, you should be able to click the "Run Tests" buttons to pass all the tests and print an amusing "Radlib" to the screen.

If you get stuck or have questions, reach out in the `#code-adventures` channel in your Slack team.

Best of luck and happy coding! :)
