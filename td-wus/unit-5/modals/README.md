# Treehouse FSJS Techdegree - Project Warm Up

## Async Modal

### SQUAD NOTES ↓↓↓ - These will be deleted and replaced before deploying the Warm Up :) 

This Warm Up is meant to help FSJS students who struggle with building their 5th TD project. It's not uncommon for them to get tripped up while trying to implement the modal and populating it with the asynchronously retrieved data. Some recreate the modal each time it is needed, adding and removing it from the DOM repeatedly. Others create a separate modal for each person in the gallery. Almost none go with the more logical approach of creating a single modal, adding it the DOM once, and just updating the data in it and displaying/hiding it as needed. And we don't demo how to create a modal in the unit lessons.  So this Warm Up is meant to bridge that gap and guide struggling students.

This directory includes currently includes the solution, which is hooked up, so you can see what the finished product will look like.

To get an idea of what students will do in this Warm Up, check out the notes and commented code in the js/script.js file.
