## End of the Line

### Intro

Something you'll encounter from time to time as a developer is working with lists that need to be looped over or clicked through repeatedly.  Say you had a set of images to show one at a time on a web page, and your user could click through the images with arrow buttons.  What would happen when they reached the end of the list?  If you don't account for it, there will likely be an error, and the app could potentially crash, disappointing your user.  Here's some lightweight practice with handling the end of the list.  You'll use JavaScript to allow your user to click to the first item when on the last, and the last item when on the first.

### Instructions

Load the `index.html` file in Chrome and open the Chrome DevTools console.  If you don't know how to do that, please reach out in Slack.  Next, follow along with the comments in the `js/script.js` file to complete this challenge.  When you are done you'll be able to endlessly scroll through items on the page by clicking the arrow buttons.

If you get stuck or have questions, reach out in the #code-adventures channel in Slack.

Best of luck and happy coding! :)
